We want to construct visualizations to understand how participants encode the positions in 3D space. Additionally, we will analyze how participants perform with objects of varying heights. The data is collected from a Vanderbilt University's behavioral study that evaluates spatial memory in an immersive virtual environment. Within the study, participants are asked to learn the layout of objects in a 3D stairwell, and they are asked to turn and face nine target objects, three times each. Raw vectors, angles, measures of angular error, and time were collected for each target object. In addition, every participant viewed objects in two conditions: (1) where objects were all placed near eye height and (2) where objects were placed above and below eye height.
